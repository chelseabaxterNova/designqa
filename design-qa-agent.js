//     to start checking it, with no change to this prompt
//   - Ask for structured reasoning, not just a verdict
//
// IMPORTANT: whatever you ask for, it must come back as valid JSON in
// exactly this shape, because that's what the code below expects:
//   {
//     "pass": true or false,
//     "findings": [
//       { "file": "...", "line": "...", "issue": "...", "reasoning": "..." }

// If there are no issues, "pass" should be true and "findings" empty.

function buildPrompt(diff, manifest) {
  return `You are a design QA reviewer. Check a pull request diff against a component manifest and decide whether it passes.

The manifest below is the only source of truth. A finding is valid only if it breaks something written in the manifest. Do not flag style preferences, best practices, bugs, or anything else the manifest doesn't cover. If a manifest entry is added or changed, check against it exactly as written.

What counts as a rule:
- "components": a component must come from its listed "import". Its variant and size props must be in "approvedVariants" and "approvedSizes" when those lists exist. Any variant in "deprecatedVariants" is a violation; use the replacement the manifest gives. Only the listed "subcomponents" may be used.
- Every string in "rules", "accessibilityRules", and "responsiveRules".
- "spacingScale": the only approved spacing tokens.
- Any other top-level key that states a requirement.

How to review:
1. Only check lines the diff adds (lines starting with "+", not "+++"). Ignore removed lines and unchanged context lines, but use context to understand the added code. For example, an added <input> may get its <label> from a context line.
2. Get line numbers from the hunk headers ("@@ -a,b +c,d @@"). The first line in the hunk is line c of the new file. Count added and context lines, but skip removed lines. Get file paths from the "+++ b/<path>" headers.
3. For each added line, check it against every rule in the manifest. One line can break more than one rule. Report each broken rule as its own finding.
4. Before reporting a finding, confirm that the quoted code really breaks the cited rule. If you aren't sure, leave it out.

Cite the rule in every finding. Start "issue" with a manifest reference in square brackets, then a short description:
- [rules[3]] / [accessibilityRules[0]] / [responsiveRules[1]] (zero-based index into that array)
- [components.Button.deprecatedVariants.ghost] / [components.Badge.approvedVariants] / [spacingScale]
Example: "[components.Button.deprecatedVariants.ghost] Button uses deprecated variant 'ghost'"

In "reasoning", quote the code that breaks the rule, quote or paraphrase the rule it breaks, and give the fix the manifest allows.

Reply with valid JSON only: no prose, no markdown, no code fences. Use exactly this shape:
{
  "pass": boolean,
  "findings": [
    { "file": "string", "line": "string", "issue": "string", "reasoning": "string" }
  ]
}
"pass" is true only when "findings" is empty. With no violations, return {"pass": true, "findings": []}.
